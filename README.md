# Null Hypothesis Test for Anomaly Detection

This repository contains all necessary code to reproduce the results of [arXiv:2210.02226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02226).

The [R&D](https://zenodo.org/record/6466204#.Y0Ao3i8Rpz8) and [BB1](https://zenodo.org/record/4536624#.Y0Ao0C8Rpz8) datasets need to be downloaded and [preprocessed](https://github.com/ManuelSzewc/Null_Hypothesis_Test_for_Anomaly_Detection/blob/main/preprocessing.ipynb).

The [SA-CWoLA](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.035003) training is performed with [this notebook](https://github.com/ManuelSzewc/Null_Hypothesis_Test_for_Anomaly_Detection/blob/main/SA_CWoLA_training.ipynb) and results are saved in the training/ folder.

Fig. 1 of the [preprint]([arXiv:2210.02226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02226)) is obtained with [this notebook](https://github.com/ManuelSzewc/Null_Hypothesis_Test_for_Anomaly_Detection/blob/main/plotter_mass_difference.ipynb) and Figs. 2 and 3 with [this notebook](https://github.com/ManuelSzewc/Null_Hypothesis_Test_for_Anomaly_Detection/blob/main/plotter_learned_output.ipynb).
